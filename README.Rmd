This package is a `pkgdown` template adapted to 
[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.org/) site.

This is a private template for use by core rOpenGov packages. 
Please donâ€™t use it for your own code.


## Setup

Add a `_pkgdown.yml` file that contains at least these lines:

```yaml
template:
  package: rogtemplate
```

Also, add a `.Rbuildignore` file on the root of your repo with these lines:

```
^\.github$
^docs$
^_pkgdown\.yml$
```

## Using `rogtemplate`

It is possible to deploy your `pkgdown` site along with `rogtemplate` via CI 
(GitHub Actions) or locally, that provides more control but it is 
not automatic.
